Maelstrom NaCl
==============

This is a port of Maelstrom 3.0.6 source to Pepper / NaCl.  The original source
comes from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/Maelstrom/source.html.

Athough Maelstrom uses SDL, and SDL has separately been ported to Pepper, I
chose not to use that.  Instead, I just developed a minimal implementation of
the parts of SDL used by Maelstrom.  I did this for educational purposes as I
wanted to learn what it would be like to do so.  As such this code is probably
not all that useful to anyone else.
